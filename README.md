## üß¨ About <a name="about"></a>

**ReproHackathon RNASeq Pipeline** is a collaborative project developed during the ReproHackathon. This RNASeq analysis pipeline, built with [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) and [Apptainer (formerly Singularity)](https://apptainer.org), is designed for reproducible research on the **Staphylococcus aureus** RNASeq dataset under antibiotic stress.

### Key Features
- **High Reproducibility**: Leveraging containers and Nextflow ensures easy deployment and consistent results across systems.
- **Data Analysis**: Includes genome mapping, read counting, and statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
- **Modular Workflow**: Nextflow's flexible design allows for easy customization and expansion of the pipeline.
